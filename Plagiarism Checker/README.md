### About Plagiarism-checker
Plagiarism-checker is a utility that checks if the given code is plagiarised from other sources on GitHub. This is done using the GitHub API.

The idea is to divide the code into smaller segments and search for each of them using the GitHub API and give a score to each segment.
Finally using some algorithm, accumulate all scores of segment, and report how much plagiarised and the sources where the code can be found.
